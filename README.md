Avila Dataset

*****************

To do the final prediction, we did the following steps on jupyter notebook:
- data visualization & exploration of the training dataset
- choice of the best model trying different ones, using cross-validation and grid search to boost the parameters
- final prediction on the testing set
We obtained an accuracy equal to:

We did an API which asks to a user to enter a value for several attributes (not all of them to avoid you losing your time ;)).
Then, we use the model we found before to make a prediction on the class it belongs.
The API is made with Flask and uses a .py file and .html file (as a template).
To be sure that the API works well, make sure that you met all the requirements


All the steps we followed and how we proceeded, the results we obtained are described in the report.
